This project analyzes lung cancer data using machine learning to identify risk factors, predict outcomes, and explore survival rates. By uncovering trends and creating predictive models, it aims to enhance early detection, guide personalized treatments, and improve patient outcomes.


Overview:
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, accounting for millions of fatalities each year. Early detection and effective treatment are critical to improving survival rates and quality of life for patients. This project aims to conduct a detailed study on lung cancer by leveraging data analysis, machine learning techniques, and knowledge to explore the factors contributing to the disease, predict outcomes, and provide actionable insights.

Objectives:

Data Analysis:

Investigate the relationship between demographic, environmental, genetic, and lifestyle factors with the risk of developing lung cancer.
Analyze patterns and trends in lung cancer diagnoses, such as age, gender, smoking habits etc.

Impact:
This study has the potential to enhance understanding of lung cancer, improve early detection rates, and guide personalized treatment strategies. By identifying high-risk individuals and providing actionable insights, this project could contribute to reducing mortality rates and improving patient outcomes.
